        q: "What is an SEO watchdog and why does our business need one?",
        a: "An SEO watchdog is an automated monitoring script that checks your website every hour for catastrophic errors—such as an accidental 'noindex' tag added during a website update, a broken robots.txt file, or a server crash. Catching these errors within an hour prevents catastrophic loss of search rankings.",
      },

        q: "Can these automations run on our private servers?",

      {
        q: "What happens if a keyword suddenly drops in rankings?",
